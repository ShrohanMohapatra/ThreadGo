THANKS FOR DOWNLOADING THREADGO
_______________________________

1. Once you have downloaded threadGo, you can root the downloaded folder
wherever you want; but for convenience you can root it in the installation
folder of the Python version you have.

2. You can import it into your code from the PATH where you have stored as
'from PATH.project.threadGo import threadMatrixProduct'. Say suppose PATH=Desktop
and your code is in the root directory where Desktop is a sub-directory,
you can import threadGo as
'from Desktop.project.threadGo import threadMatrixProduct'.

3. For documentation, go to 'docs' folder and find the file named
'threadGoDocs.pdf'. Here you can find information about what and how the 
product has been designed and also some interesting features of the internal
architecture of the software.

4. You can refer to the program 'example.py' to check out how the package
can be used to perform unbelievably fast and efficient matrix multiplication.
